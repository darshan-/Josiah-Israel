pause button
disabled play button (and seek and skip buttons?)
updatePlayPauseButton()
Slide in new song title from right
  slide old song title to left
  Use same timing as sliding song info
    (rather than changing instantly in the middle of that transition)
  Or slide up

Listen for page zoom-in / -out and reflow content
  This is necessary because you hard-code the content height
   after adding song list
