I wrote this in the winter of 2000.  It's been one of my favorite
songs ever since, but for some reason I never got around to recording
it until today.</p> <p><i>Every morning, I get real tired, and I lie

One of the only songs up here right now in which I actually sing.  I
love singing, but most of my songwriting lately has been done in the
wee hours of the morning, when Asha's sleeping, so my only option is
electronic music and headphones.</p>

<p>When I write songs, I usually just sing whatever random words come
out of my mouth. Sometimes I keep them; other times I go back and
write real lyrics.  In the case of <i>'fore I</i>, I felt embarrassed
by the initial \"word soup,\" so when I played it for Asha for the
first time, I warned her that the lyrics were stupid and that I was
planning on writing real lyrics soon.</p>

<p>When she heard it, however, she said that she loved the lyrics and
that I had to keep them. She explained that they meant:</p>

<p><i>'fore I get out of town</i> = before I die</p>

<p><i>I better watch/jump with ladies on the trampoline; watch/swim
with women in the submarine</i> = have fun connecting with pretty
ladies</p>

<p><i>I'm gonna knock your socks off / rock your world 'til you're in
love with me</i> = make music that rocks / have fun connecting with
pretty ladies</p>
